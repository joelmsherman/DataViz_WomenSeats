# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 9, 2021
**Women Representation in Government in the EU**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 9 of 2021 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w9) showing women's % of government seats held by year, for each of several EU nations. 

## Data Source
Data is from EuroStat [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/sdg_05_50)

## My Approach for Week 46
The original viz is way too busy.  I chose to simply and drive home the basic truth that there is disparity in women's representation in government, no matter which country in the EU one looks at.
